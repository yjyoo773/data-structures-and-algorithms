# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A data structure of a 'linked list'. It is a list of nodes that are linked together with a value and `next`. It starts with a head and the next will contain the data with the next values and objects next of it. the tail which is the end piece has the next is null. 
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a method `insert` which take an argument adding a new node with that value to the `head`
- Create a method `includes` which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
