# Binary Search Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A data structure of a 'binary tree / binary search tree'. The data structure starts with the `root` node. Upto two other nodes can be attached to each node as `left` and `right`. As for the binary search tree, values less than the current node are assigned to the left of the node and values greater are assigned right. This allows the searching values within this data structure have a time complexity of O(N).
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a method `add` which takes a value arguement. If the root is empty this value becomes the root. If the value is greater than the root and the right is empty it fulfills that spot. This continues if the right is not empty. Similarly if the value is less than the root and so on it is added to the left of the node.
- Create three methods to traverse the tree preorder, inorder, and post order.
